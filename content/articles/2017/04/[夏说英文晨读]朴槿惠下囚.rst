A South Korean court ordered the arrest of Park Geun-hye, the former president,
on charges of bribery and abuse of power. Ms Park, who was removed from office
three weeks ago, will be jailed while prosecutors seek an indictment for her
alleged role in a corruption scandal. The court said that if Ms Park was not
taken into custody she might "destroy evidence".
