The International Energy Agency warned that cuts to investment in the oil industry
could haunt consumers by the end of the decade. New production investments have
tumbled in recent years as oil prices dropped to below $30 per barrel. The IEA
reckons this could lead to a spike in prices by 2020, should global demand outstrip
new supplies.
