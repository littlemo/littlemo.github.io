Warren Buffett used his annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders to
defend big firms' share buybacks and to attack active money managers who poor
advice and overcharge. He highlighted the economic contribution made by "talented
and ambitious immigrants", in an apparent swipe at Donald Trump, and predicted
that the economy "will deliver increasing wealth to our progeny far into the
future".
