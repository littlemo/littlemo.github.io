The Conference Board’s consumer-confidence index, which measures both American
consumers' assessment of current conditions and their expectations, rose to
its highest level since 2001. Updated figures from the Commerce Department
confirmed earlier estimates that the economy grew by 1.6% year-on-year in 2016,
the slowest rate for five years--though growth picked up to 1.9% in final quarter.
