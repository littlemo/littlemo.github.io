South Africa's environment ministry reported a second yesr of decline in rhino
poaching. Illegal killings rose from fewer than 100 in 2008, driven by demand
for rhino horn in traditional medicines. But the number peaked in 2014; last
year they fell by 10%, to 1,054, thanks mostly to better policing. Poachers
also killed 46 elephants in the Kruger National Park.
